I: Thanks so much for speaking with me today. We’re talking about how people think about and protect their digital identity — how you use technology, what precautions you take, and how you feel about it all. Sound alright?

R: Sure, that’s fine. I’m not the most technical person, but I’ll do my best.

I: First off, what kinds of digital accounts do you use these days? Things like email, social media, banking, maybe health portals?

R: Let’s see. I have an email I check daily — Gmail. I do some online banking, mostly just checking balances or paying a few bills. I use MyChart for my medical stuff. I’m on Facebook to keep up with the kids and grandkids. That’s about it. Oh — and I stream TV on Netflix and Hulu.

I: Thanks. Do you use different passwords for those accounts?

R: I try to. I keep a little notebook where I write them down. I know people say not to do that, but it works for me. I don’t use the same password for everything, but I’m sure some of them are a little too similar.

I: How often do you update your passwords or use two-factor authentication?

R: I only change passwords if the site tells me to. As for the two-step thing, yes — I’ve had a few sites send me codes to my phone, and I do that. It’s a bit of a hassle sometimes, especially if I’m on the iPad and my phone’s across the room. But I understand why it’s important.

I: Have you ever been notified of a data breach?

R: I did get a letter from one of the credit bureaus a few years ago — I think it was Equifax — saying my information might have been part of a breach. I didn’t really know what to do, but my daughter helped me put a freeze on my credit. I haven’t had any trouble since then.

I: Do you use a password manager?

R: No, I’ve heard of those, but they sound complicated. I just stick to my notebook. I keep it in a drawer, not right by the computer. I know it’s not foolproof, but it’s what I’m comfortable with.

I: Can you remember the last time you looked at your privacy settings?

R: Not really. Maybe when I first set up Facebook years ago, but not recently. I try to be careful about what I post. I don’t share my birthday or phone number on there. I’ve asked my family not to tag me in public posts either.

I: What does “protecting your digital identity” mean to you?

R: I guess it means being careful — not giving out personal information unless I know who I’m dealing with. I think about things like scams and people pretending to be someone else. I don’t do online shopping much, partly because I’m worried about giving out my card number.

I: How confident do you feel about the safety of your personal information online?

R: Hmm. I’m cautious, but I wouldn’t say I’m confident. There’s just so much I don’t know. I do my best — I don’t click on strange emails, and I ask my kids if I’m unsure — but it still feels like things could go wrong, even if I’m being careful.

I: Do you think most people understand the risks?

R: I think younger folks are more familiar with the tech, but maybe that makes them too trusting. Older people like me are more cautious, but also more confused. I know friends who’ve fallen for email scams or clicked on fake pop-ups. It's scary.

I: Which do you think is more important: convenience or privacy?

R: Privacy. I’ll take a few extra steps if it means my information is safe. It’s not always easy, but I’d rather be slow and safe than quick and sorry.

I: If you could change something about how digital identity works online, what would it be?

R: I wish companies explained things more clearly — less jargon. Just tell me what you’re collecting and let me say yes or no. And maybe give people a phone number to call if they get stuck, not just chatbots and links.

I: Has this conversation brought up anything else for you?

R: It’s reminded me how much I rely on my family to help me with this stuff. I do okay, but I wouldn’t feel comfortable managing everything alone. It would be nice if there were more support for older people to learn about this without feeling embarrassed.

I: That’s a really important point. Thanks again for your honesty — this was incredibly helpful.

R: Glad to help. I hope it’s useful to someone.
